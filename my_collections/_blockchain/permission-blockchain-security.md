# Abstract
As permissioned blockchain becomes a common foundation of blockchainbased applications for current organizations, related stakeholders of the applications need  the means to assess the security risks of the applications. To address this issue, this study proposes a security risk management framework for permissioned blockchain applications. The framework divides itself into different implementation stacks and provides guidelines to control the security risks of the permissioned blockchain application.
According to the best of our knowledge, this study is the first research that provides a means to evaluate and control the security risks of permissioned blockchain applications from a holistic point of view. If users can trust the applications that adopted this framework, this study can hopefully contribute to the adoption of permissioned blockchain technologies.

# Introduction
Due to the popularity of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies built on  blockchain technology, blockchain technology is now at the center stage of the world. Several organizations have launched their blockchain applications. However, it is said that “the water that bears the boat is the same that swallows it up.'' When the prices of Bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies crashed in Dec. 2017, the experts are reconsidering the value of blockchain applications. Moreover, current blockchain application providers may need to convince their clients that they are not going blockchain for blockchain's sake. In addition, researches shown the propose criteria to decide whether applications are suitable to use  blockchain technology. For example,  McAbee et al. mentioned critical factors to determine the adoption of blockchain technology in the military intelligence process
